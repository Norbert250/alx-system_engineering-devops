0x07. Networking basics #0

A network can be best described as a connection and sharing of information or resources between different computers or other devices. Some of the basic concepts in a network are:

1. **Network:** A group of interconnected computers, servers, mainframes, network devices, and other devices sharing information and resources.

2. **Nodes:** One of the connected devices by which one defines everything bound to each network point; it can be a computer, server, printer, and routers.

3. **Topology:** The network's topology is the structure through which nodes connect to other nodes and the physical layout of those elements, like the wires, as well as the virtual layout of the links between them. Commonly used topologies include star, bus, ring, mesh, and hybrid.

4. **LAN (Local Area Network):** When a limited geographical area, such as an office, building, or group of buildings, has a network laid out in it, that network runs all devices allowed to communicate with one another within that LAN without restrictions.

5. **WAN (Wide Area Network):** This is the network created for serving an entire people group/country or countries, linking LANs in one country with LANs in other countries while covering a large geographical region. The internet is naturally considered the most famous global WAN.

6. **Router:** A Router is a device that connects different networks with each other so as to direct flow of data traffic between devices that belong to one network with those of another.

7. **Switch:** A switch connects different devices placed inside one network. It functions in the data link layer and forwards packages of data to the needed destination, utilizing MAC addresses.

8. **Hub:** This is a simple device used for connections of all devices in a LAN. Contrary to switches, hubs lack the intelligent forwarding capability and simply receive and broadcast information to all devices connected to it.

9. **IP Address:** An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device on a computer network using Internet Protocol (IP) for communication between other machines on this network. It primarily serves the purpose of location addressing and network routing.

10. **Subnet:** This may be best described as a logical part of the network connected using OSI model Layer 3 (network layer, IP).

11. **DNS (Domain Name System):** It is a simple software system that translates human-readable domain names into Internet Protocol, i.e. IP addresses. DNS enables the facility to reach websites according to their names, not addresses, in digit form.

12. **Protocols:** These are networking protocols which govern communication between nodes in the network of rules and conventions. Examples include TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).

13. **Firewall:** It is a network security device to monitor and control the flow of incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously determined security policies. It also protects a network from unauthorized access and threatening contents.

14. **Wireless Networking:** The signal is in wireless mode while transmitting information among different devices by using radio waves or infrared. Wi-Fi is one of the technologies used for wireless LANs.

15. **Bandwidth: Ratio of the highest data transfer rate into the network.** Bandwidth is normally measured by bits per second (bps), kilobits per second (kbps), or megabits per second (Mbps). This basic understanding may be useful for practitioners in dealing with computer networks on any scale: from home and small offices to large professional networks and IT career life.
