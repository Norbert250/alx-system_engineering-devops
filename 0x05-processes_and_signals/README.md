On Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, signals are software interrupts. They provide a way for the user (or a process) to directly communicate with a process.

Software may be programmed to respond intelligently to a wide array of signals, and certain signals cause processes to behave in a standardized, predefined way at the kernel level.
